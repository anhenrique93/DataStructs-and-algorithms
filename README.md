# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of classic data structures and algorithms in **C**, **C++**, and **C#**. The goal is to practice and deepen understanding of fundamental concepts by comparing implementations across these languages.

## Repository Structure

Each language has its own folder with subfolders for data structures and algorithms:
- **C/**
  - `data_structures/`: Implementations of common data structures like lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
  - `algorithms/`: Algorithms organized by category (sorting, searching, graph algorithms, recursion, etc.).

- **C++/**
  - Similar structure to C, with the use of classes and STL for some implementations.

- **CSharp/**
  - Implements data structures and algorithms in C# with .NET features.

## How to Run
Each folder contains instructions on compiling and running the code for that specific language.
